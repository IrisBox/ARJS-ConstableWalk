# ARJS-ConstableWalk

The [ARJS-Walking-with-Constable.zip](/ARJS-Walking-with-Constable.zip)  file contains the most up to date code and images. It also contains instructions for setting up a server and running it from an android device, as well as a list of the image details (to match numbers to names) and pdf file containing the tags/qr codes to print for use.

The full sized images can also all be found here:

... Along with other image based outputs from the project.

We'd love any feedback if anyone tries using it!
