# ARJS-ConstableWalk

The [ARJS-Walking-with-Constable.zip](/ARJS-Walking-with-Constable.zip)  file contains the most up to date code and images. It also contains instructions for setting up a server and running it from an android device, as well as a list of the image details (to match numbers to names) and pdf file containing the tags/qr codes to print for use.

The full sized images can also all be found here:
https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/collections/constable
... Along with other image based outputs from the project.

We haven't yet compiled an interactive map showing all print locations, but there are maps embedded into each of the walk pages that show the walk routes, as well as print and aerial photo locations, which contin links to the full size images as above. These can be found here:

We'd love any feedback if anyone tries using it!
